Depositing 
	The deposits handler has been removed as the associated paypal business account has been deactivated.  The code should still paint the picture of how it works
	A unique payment experience is created for each deposit, with the user being asked to pay the amount they requested to deposit
	Upon the payment being verified the amount paid is added to the userâ€™s balance
	Withdrawals are not automatic, as they are meant to be checked manually prior to approval
